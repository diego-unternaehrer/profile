        <h1>Diego Unternaehrer</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>A Swiss army knife</strong>.
          <br/><br/>
          Enthusiastic about fashion, media, events, and philosophy.
          Highly creative but still organised, analytical, and goal-driven.
          My educational background is a mixture of commerce & management and art & design.
          Having worked, lived, and studied in several countries and cultures has made me open to constant change and looking at the bigger picture.

        <h2>Artist 👨🏼‍🎨</h2>
        <p>
          I mostly do paintings and other visual artwork.
          Being creative as an artist allows me to express my thoughts without corporate boundaries.
          This enables me to explore new ideas and refresh my mind.

        <h2>Manager 👨🏼‍💼</h2>
        <p>
          Having studied Media and Event Mangement taught me to manage contemporary event concepts and modern media.
          In a Minor programme in Global Trendwatching, I learnt to translate  important global and local developments and movements into future visions and come up with creative ideas for innovative strategies, products, services, and communication campaigns.
          As a result, I am able to work in an ever-changing environment.
